Routes
	Built in Laravel Auth routes

	Route::resource(User); // CRUD for User model, so you can create, read(get the profile of a User), update (update information such as age, name, gender, etc.), delete Users. E.g., yappietravels.com/JaneDoe
	
	Route::resource(User.Blog) // CRUD for Blog model, so you can create, read (see below), update (might except this), delete Blogs. Might want to look at Sub-Domain Routing so you can do e.g., fooblog.yappietravels.com/Colombia/092015
		@get:
			middleware(Auth::isGuest || Auth::isNotUser) -> return that user's blog
			middleware(Auth::isUser) -> allow user to modify her blog
	
	Route::get(Region) // display most recent posts for the selected region. E.g., yappietravels.com/Regions/NorthAfrica

	Route::get(Region.Countries) // display most recent posts for the selected country. E.g., yappietravels.com/Countries/Ethiopia

	Route::resource(Blog.Photos) // CRUD for photos. E.g., fooblog.yappietravels.com/photos

User Experience
	INDEX PAGE
		{GUEST}
			See a top nav-bar (which includes homepage link, link to list of all blogs, link to recent blogPosts/reviews?). Also login/register buttons on the right hand corner
			See some stupid masthead/banner logo thing.
			See a list of countries (at least in v0.1. Eventually it should show a world map where you can click on any country to see the blogposts/reviews of that country but I might have to outsource that part)
				CLICK ON A COUNTRY
					See a list of blogposts/reviews of that country
			See a Featured Blogs section on the left half, and a Recent Blog Posts section on the right half
			See a footer with copyright information
		{USER}
			Extends {GUEST}
			On top nav-bar, there is a link to your admin panel
				CLICK ADMIN
					See same nav-bar as {GUEST}/{USER}, probably will put that into a partial
					See Admin Panel Heading
						See "Create a Review" button
						See recent reviews as bootstrap-nav-pills
					See Profile Heading
						See form (name, Age, About Me)
