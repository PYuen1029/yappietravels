		For Everyone:

			The initial landing page (/). == DONE

				INTEGRATE Theme: Sedulous

			You can see an individual user profile (/user/{user}) ==
				Theme: same as '/'
				Should have a profile picture, profile == DONE

				recent blog posts (as well as a button view more posts) == 
					Pagination == 
						check out https://github.com/bestmomo/lumenvue

						I need a backend controller to return JSON data

						I need the vue-resource stuff to send the requests

				If you are logged in && aren't friends with them, you will see a button to send a friend request.
					If you are a guest, the button will be faded, and it will say you have to log in in order to send friend requests

			You can see all blogs (/blog [should be changed to ...blogs])

				Theme: same as '/'

				Paginated. Ordered by the ones that were most recently active.

				Should include the author's name that links to /user/{user}

				Sidebars:
					Sidebar1 should have featured blogs.

					Sidebar2 should have most recent posts.

			You can see all posts (/blogPost)
				Theme: same as '/'

				Paginated. Ordered by most recent.

				Sidebars: same as '/blog'

			You can see an individual blog (/blog/{blog})
				Theme: http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/
					with the banner customizable by the blog owner

				See a blog-description and shit. And then a paginated list of blogposts

				If you are the owner, you will see an edit button that will redirect to blog/{blog}/edit

			You can see an individual post (/blog/{blog}/blogPost/{blogPost})
				Theme: same as /blog/{blog}

				Should include a very short description (3 lines max). The meat is the pictures delivered by the slideshow plugin.

				If you are the owner, you will see an edit button that will redirect to blog/{blog}/edit

		For Auth'd Bloggers:

			You can edit your profile (/user/edit)
				Theme: '/'

			You can edit your blog (/blog/{blog}/edit [change to blog/edit])
				Change the banner pic

				Change the name and tagline

				Also lists each published blogPost and allows you to edit or delete them

			You can edit a blog post (/blog/{blog}/blogPost/{blogPost}/edit)
				Allows you to edit the title, tagline, content, and publish date

				Includes dropzone to add regular files

				Includes a featured image that you can edit or add if it is blank

				Includes a gallery of pictures already added, as well as the ability to edit or delete it



	REFACTOR, REFACTOR, REFACTOR

		Make it so if a guest visits yappietravels they go to the index page. But if you're logged in you go to your user.index page.

	Implement countries' page functionality

	use mod_rewrite to fix messy urls (read: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/an-in-depth-guide-to-mod_rewrite-for-apache--net-6708)
]
==================================
========      PHASE 2     ========
==================================
[
	work on regions and countries
		probably add in PagesController to display all BlogPosts where country is in country.Probably means a BlogPost should have a country field (probably with the country code)

	work on the review angle of the website

	Make Route('/') #recentposts reactive with JS, so if someone creates a new post while you're browsing that page, it will update.

	Make it a lot more javascript-intense. There won't be any separate views for editing a blog post, or blog, or at least it will be possible to edit it straight from blog/{blog}/blogPost/{blogPost}. Similarly with editing your user profile
